Although mechanical devices make life easier by automating various tasks, they are no source of infinite power and require maintenance to continue functioning as intended.
This page will go over the various kinds of decay these devices are susceptible to, how to protect them against this and how to repair them.

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Rule Of Thumb</font>
  - Objects last longer inside
  - Not repairing objects will result in loss of efficiency and at some point 
    the destruction of the object itself.
  - You can't do maintenance on a mechanical block if it is active.
    (receiving mechanical power usually means it's active)
  - Maintenance has it's limits, at some point you will have to replace it.
  - Better metal = longer life span

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Wind Decay</font>
Sails and the like will slowly wear an tear as they are exposed to wind. Sails can be rolled up by crouch interacting with an empty hand, this will prevent the sail from taking damage while you don't need it to be active.
Sails and other cloth like objects can be repaired with <a href=\"handbook://item-sewingkit\">sewing kits</a>

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Humidity Decay</font>
Blocks made of wood such as gears are susceptible to damage from humidity, the two main ways of reducing this damage ar as following:
  - Waxing the wood using <a href=\"handbook://item-beeswax\">beeswax</a>. (keep in mind that the wax coating
    also decays and will have to be renewed)
  - Keeping the object inside. (using <a href=\"handbook://block-millwright:woodenaxlepassthroughfull\">pass through axles</a> from MillWright is 
    highly recommended to keep infrastructure inside whenever possible)

Most Wooden objects can be repaired with <a href=\"handbook://item-resin\">resin</a> or <a href=\"handbook://item-wearandtear:woodfiller\">woodfiller</a>.

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Usage Decay</font>
Items such as helve hammers will take damage as they are used, you can prevent excessive damage to the helve hammer by making sure it isn't smashing against the anvil while you aren't using it.
These kind of items usually can't be repaired and have to be replaced when broken.

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Metal parts</font>
Metal parts can be repaired using matching <a href=\"handbook://item-metalnailsandstrips-copper\">nails and strips</a> and a hammer in the offhand

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Troubleshooting</font>
if you can't repair something and you're not getting an error message try doing it while crouching and in the case of multiblocks try out the different blocks. On the Fruit Press for instance you need to crouch and aim at the bottom block. In the case of Metal Parts make sure your repair material matches the metal type (so Black bronze nails and strips for a Black bronze reinforcement)
