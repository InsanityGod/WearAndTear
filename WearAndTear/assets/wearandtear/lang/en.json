The following devices break down over time and require occasional maintence / replacement:
	- Windmill
	- Helve hammer
	- Helve axe (if 'Helve Axe addon for In dappled Groves' is installed)

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Windmill Maintenance</font>
Windmill sails will slowly tear over time, by default they last about a year in average wind speeds though the efficiency will have gone down significantly by then.
To repair the sails you will first need to stop the windmill from moving after which you can use a sewing kit to fix the sails. (1 sewing kit is enough to fully repair 2 sails worth of durability)"
